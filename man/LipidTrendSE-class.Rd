This class extends SummarizedExperiment to store
analyzeLipidRegion analysis results
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{split_chain}}{Logical indicating whether chains were split by parity.
When TRUE, results are stored in even_chain_result and odd_chain_result.
When FALSE, results are stored in the result slot.}

\item{\code{result}}{Data frame of analysis results (for non-split data)}

\item{\code{even_chain_result}}{Data frame of results for even chains (when split)}

\item{\code{odd_chain_result}}{Data frame of results for odd chains (when split)}
}}
